            "This aspect creates two groups of people. People in the first group tend to give up when they encounter problems. When people in the second group encounter problems they get stimulated by them and perform better. These people often have lower self-esteem that can be improved by good work.\n",

            "This aspect creates people that are too individualistic, selfish and eccentric. They are very independent and they guard their independence carefully. They are not always considerate towards other people and they sometimes suffer from mental exhaustion. These people have the need to be different and they want to show their uniqueness. They want to be teachers, mentors and examples to others. These people are willing to go to the extremes in order to show their originality. They have trouble accepting authorities. They use rebellion as means of attracting attention of other people.\n",

            "This aspect creates people that are overly empathetic and too willing to sacrifice themselves, and thus they may easily be used by others or cheated. These people should stay away from drugs, alcohol and tobacco because they have considerable tendencies to use drugs and alcohol to solve their problems.\n",

            "People with this aspect are responsible, reserved and hesitant. They also have restraints that are often the result of poor parenting or fear of other authorities. This also causes fear of loss - they are afraid to lose both their property and their loved ones. These people often submit their feelings to practicality (typical manifestation of this is getting married for security). They subconsciously fear unemployment and poverty.\n",

            "This aspect complicates any relationship because these people see relationships literally as a loss of personal freedom and integrity. They are mentally unstable and their feelings constantly change. They often get involved in great number of relationships throughout their life. They are unconventional, difficult to get along with, eccentric and original when they create art. They are just as unstable in their ways of dealing with money. They are adventurous and they lead unstable love life.\n",

Esoteric activities sometimes become more important to them than the reality and take away considerable amounts of energy from the relationship. These people should try to be more rational and have \"thick skin\". They are usually very lazy. For artists, this aspect brings inspiration, creativity, imagination, and very good taste.\n",

            "It is necessary to distinguish which of the two planets is dominant in this conjunction. If Saturn is dominant, then the person is able to keep his imagination under control and use it constructively to fulfill his dreams. However, if Neptune is dominant, then the fantasy is too vivid, and these people fail to fulfill their fantasies and they become frustrated. They start living in their fantasy world and they become practically useless. These people can experience great spiritual passion - they may expand their consciousness at all costs and use all possible means to achieve their goal (spiritual fanatics).\n",
